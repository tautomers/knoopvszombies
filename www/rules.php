            <div>(last update: October 12th, 2014)</div>
            <div>Humans vs. Zombies (HvZ) is a game of tag of epic proportions. There are two teams, the Human Resistance, and the Zombie Horde. All players begin as Humans, except one who is randomly chosen to be the Original Zombie (Players can opt out of being chosen as the Original Zombie). The Original Zombie tags Human players, turning them into Zombies. The Zombies must "feed" on a Human every 60 hours, by tagging them, or they starve to death and are out of the game. The Humans can defend themselves from the Zombies with various game approved equipment stated below.</div>

                <LI>No realistic looking weaponry. All Nerf devices must be inspected by a mod before the game. Approved devices will be marked with a zip-tie as proof they've been inspected. Using a Nerf device that hasn't been inspected will result in removal from the game.

                <LI>Play inside buildings is strictly forbidden. Doing so will result in removal from the game. The exception to this is around doorways.
                <LI>Common Sense. If something seems excessively dangerous, don't do it.
                <LI>Stairs are safe for humans only. Zombies can be stunned on stairs, humans can not be tagged as long as they have at least one foot on the stairs. To count as stairs, there must be <a href="http://i.imgur.com/NeCVwFa.jpg">three vertical faces.</a>

Players on roller blades are always safe because a push will cause them to move. (Please don't ride bikes, skateboards, or rollerblades at missions. You may use them to get to and from the mission location only).

            <div>I.D. Number: Humans must keep two index cards with their unique identification number on them at all times, to be used for identification purposes and for Zombie feeding. Zombies must carry one card, simply for identification purposes. It's also recommended to write your ID code on your bandana that way you never lose it!</div>
          </div>

          <div class="even">
            <div><span class="rules_heading">Game Mechanics</span></div>
            <div>Stunning a Zombie: Humans may stun a Zombie for 15 minutes by shooting them with a Nerf marker, throwing a sock at them, or landing a hit with a marshmallow. All projectiles must leave a blaster or hand to be valid.  A stunned zombie must place his/her headband around his neck.</div>
            <div>When Tagged By a Zombie: When tagged by a Zombie, a Human is required to give the Zombie one of their ID cards, which the Zombie will use to register the tag.  The player is now a Stunned Zombie and will become an unstunned Zombie fifteen minutes after being tagged.</div>
            <div>Wearing an Armband: Humans must wear provided bandanna around their bicep to identify at all times that they are in a game-on zone to identify them as Humans players in the game. (This will come in handy when you become a Zombie!) Zombies must wear the bandanna on their head, OVER hoodies, hats, hair, etc. so that it is visible at all times from all angles.</div>
            <div>Time keeping: Players must be able to keep track of time, such as with a watch or cell phone.</div>
            <div>Zombies must "feed" to survive. A Zombie feeds by reporting their tag to the website, within 2 hours of the tag (please contact a moderator if you are having difficulties ASAP). If a Zombie's clock runs out from lack of feeding, they "starve", and are out of the game as a "deceased" player, who occasionally have minor roles in the game (so still keep your bandana). When a Zombie feeds, they gain 48 hours of time. A zombies's feed clock maxes out at 60 hours.</div>
            <div>Deceased: Deceased players are zombies who have starved out of the game by failing to feed within 48 hours as a zombie. They are indicated by wearing their bandana on their upper thigh. They may not make tags, stun, be stunned, or interact with regular gameplay. However, they can have important roles during missions and special events during the game (including the final mission!). Emails will be sent informing deceased regarding their roles as the game progresses. <font color="#EEEEEE">ALL HAIL CHAOS</font></div>
            <div>Wearing Your Headband: Zombies must wear the bandanna around their head at all times while playing. Again, make sure it is over hats, hoods, hair, etc. See headband rules for more details.</div>
            <div>A tag is a firm touch to a Human, including any items on their person excluding blasters. (Keep in mind where an appropriate place to tag a Human is. Use good judgment; any violation of this rule is against game policy as well as being incredibly disrespectful, and will result in removal from the game at the very least). After tagging a Human the Zombie must collect one of the Human's ID card, and must report their tag to get credit for feeding.</div>
            <div>Getting Tagged: When hit with a Human Nerf device, a Zombie is stunned for 15 minutes. A stunned Zombie may not interact with the game in any way. This includes shielding other Zombies from bullets, continuing to run toward a Human, or providing information to the Horde. If shot while already stunned, the Zombie's stun timer is not reset back to 15 minutes. You will receive an email automatically when you have officially been turned on the game website.</div>
            <div>If a stunned Zombie encounters human players, they should raise one hand and identify themselves as stunned. Stunned zombies should not stalk human players, as this can sway the game, and isn't very sportsmanly. A good rule is to stay out of nerf dart range from humans when stunned. Excessive gameplay interaction when stunned may result in disciplinary action.</div>
            <div>Altered Mechanics: As a reward for missions, mechanics above may be modified. If this occurs all players will be emailed the conditions.</div>
          </div>

          <div class="odd">
            <div><span class="rules_heading">Original Zombies</span></div>
            <div>The Original Zombies (typically 1-5) are randomly chosen at the beginning of the game. (You can opt-out if you want when you add yourself to the game, or go into your account settings). They identify as a Human for a few days (the Original Zombie period). This means that they wear the bandanna on their arm. They tote Nerf blasters, they carry socks, marshmallows, whatever. They can even stun Zombies if they want. For all intents and purposes, they are Human. Except that they can tag Humans to turn them into Zombies. At the end of the Original Zombie period, the Original Zombie becomes a normal Zombie, and must follow the Zombie Rules. If you do NOT receive an email from a mod informing you that you are an OZ, then you are NOT an OZ.</div>
            <div>An email from the mods will be sent when the Original Zombie period ends.</div>

Please don't paint blasters completely black or other colors found on realistic weaponry. We'll have spray-paint at the orientations to help you make sure your nerf blasters meet standards. All devices except socks and marshmallows must be approved by a Moderator prior to use. Approved devices will be marked as such by a zip-tie.  Projectiles must not hurt on impact.</div>
            <div>Blasters may be modded. However, they must still fall under the aforementioned guidelines.
            <div>Nerf blasters cannot fire anything except foam projectiles such as darts or balls. Socks must be clean. Socks must be thrown; they can be modified, but only by adding more socks.</div>

                <LI>Segways: If you are standing on one, you are out of play.

            <div><span class="rules_heading">Rule Violations</span></div>
            <div>In the case where a rule has been violated, moderators will make a decision on the appropriate course of action. Most of the time, this is simply a warning, or nothing at all. For more serious occurrances, the rules head and or executive council may be involved. Possible actions include, but are not limited to:</div>
            <div><OL class="rules">
              <LI>Verbal notice.
              <LI>Written notice.
              <LI>Action nullification (i.e. tag or stun doesn't count).
              <LI>Temporary removal from the game.
              <LI>Full removal from the game.
              <LI>Banned from the current game.
              <LI>Banned from HvZ.
              <LI>University is contacted and notified.
            </OL></div>
          </div>

          <div class="odd">
            <div><span class="rules_heading">Other Rules</span></div>
            <div>A mod does not need to cite a rule to make a ruling during game.</div>
            <div>The mod squad will never use Facebook, twitter, etc. to distribute mission details.</div>
            <div>Tagging non-players is a bannable offense. And a rude move. Don't do it.</div>
            <div>People who are not part of the game cannot interact with it. This includes spying or bringing supplies to barricaded Humans.</div>
            <div>Zombies must have both feet outside a safe zone to tag a Human.</div>
            <div>If there is a dispute over a tag and or stun (i.e. a tag and stun happened at the same time), this is settled by way of rock, paper, siccsors. If a mod is near by we will officiate this. Winner best 2 out of 3.</div>
            <div>Shields are not allowed. Neither are melee weapons.  A tag on a backpack is considered a tag on the player (otherwise the backpack would be a shield, which is not allowed).</div>
            <div>Athletes during practices or games are safe.</div>
            <div>Anyone participating in official or required events, such as jobs or meetings, is safe.</div>
            <div>Humans may stun Zombies from inside safe zones to clear exits.</div>
            <div>Those that are required to wear a uniform, such as players in ROTC, are not required to wear the headband during that time. This effectively removes them from the game for that amount of time; as such, they cannot be tagged.</div>
            <div>Unless you're in a sanctioned activity, please don't remove yourself from the game. Taking off your bandanna to walk to class may result in removal from the game.</div>
            <div>If there is a real emergency, call 911.  For game-related, non-emergency help please try to find a mod (wearing a pink arm/headband) or email mods@osundead.com.</div>
            <div>Finally, be fair, have fun, and be kind to each other. This is a game, and only a game! If at any time you think you are violating this rule, stop and think about it. If something seems unfair, it probably is. If it seems un-fun, then something is probably wrong. This is a game, and games are meant to be fun. Try and play the game in a way that makes it good for everyone involved. Don't be selfish. And lastly, HAVE FUN!</div>
