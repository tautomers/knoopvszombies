            <div>(last update: October 12th, 2014)</div>
            <div>Humans vs. Zombies (HvZ) is a game of tag of epic proportions. There are two teams, the Human Resistance, and the Zombie Horde. All players begin as Humans, except one who is randomly chosen to be the Original Zombie (Players can opt out of being chosen as the Original Zombie). The Original Zombie tags Human players, turning them into Zombies. The Zombies must "feed" on a Human every 60 hours, by tagging them, or they starve to death and are out of the game. The Humans can defend themselves from the Zombies with various game approved equipment stated below.</div>

                <LI>Game devices may not be visible inside of academic buildings or jobs on campus (i.e. Nerf Devices). Make sure they are tucked away entirely, with no handles showing, etc.
                <LI>Nerf markers must not hurt on impact. (If you're not sure about this, ask a moderator).
                <LI>Common Sense. If something seems excessively dangerous, don't do it.
                <LI>Stairs are safe for humans only. Zombies can be stunned on stairs, humans can not be tagged as long as they have at least one foot on the stairs. To count as stairs, there must be three vertical faces.

                <LI>Vehicles: Players on/in vehicles are outside of the game. They cannot be attacked, and cannot attack.  Players on roller blades are always safe because a push will cause them to move. (Please don't ride bikes, skateboards, or rollerblades at missions. You may use them to get to and from the mission location, but using them during the mission falls under DBAD).

            <div><span class="rules_heading">Identification</span></div>
            <div>I.D. Number: Humans must keep two index cards with their unique identification number on them at all times, to be used for identification purposes and for Zombie feeding. Zombies must carry one card, simply for identification purposes.</div>
          </div>

          <div class="odd">
            <div><span class="rules_heading">Game Mechanics</span></div>
            <div>Stunning a Zombie: Humans may stun a Zombie for 15 minutes by shooting them with a Nerf marker, throwing a sock at them, or landing a hit with a marshmallow.  A stunned zombie must place his/her headband around his neck.</div>
            <div>When Tagged By a Zombie: When tagged by a Zombie, a Human is required to give the Zombie one of their ID cards, which the Zombie will use to register the tag.  The player is now a Stunned Zombie and will become an unstunned Zombie fifteen minutes after being tagged.</div>
            <div>Wearing an Armband: Humans must wear provided bandanna around their bicep to identify at all times that they are in a game-on zone to identify them as Humans players in the game. (This will come in handy when you become a Zombie!) Zombies must wear the bandanna on their head, OVER hoodies, hats, hair, etc. so that it is visible at all times from all angles.</div>
            <div>Time keeping: Players must be able to keep track of time, such as with a watch or cell phone.</div>
            <div>Zombies must "feed" every 60 hours. A Zombie feeds by reporting their tag to the website, within 2 hours of the tag. If a Zombie does not feed, every 60 hours, they "starve", and are out of the game. When a Zombie feeds, this 60 hour timer is reset.</div>
            <div>Wearing Your Headband: Zombies must wear the bandanna around their head at all times while playing. Again, make sure it is over hats, hoods, hair, etc.</div>
            <div>A tag is a firm touch to a Human. (Keep in mind where an appropriate place to tag a Human is. Use good judgment; any violation of this rule is against game policy as well as being incredibly disrespectful, and will result in removal from the game at the very least). After tagging a Human the Zombie must collect one of the Human's ID card, and must report their tag to get credit for feeding.</div>
            <div>Getting Tagged: When hit with a Human Nerf device, a Zombie is stunned for 15 minutes. A stunned Zombie may not interact with the game in any way. This includes shielding other Zombies from bullets, continuing to run toward a Human, or providing information to the Horde. If shot while already stunned, the Zombie's stun timer is not reset back to 15 minutes.</div>
            <div>If a stunned Zombie encounters human players, they should raise one hand and identify themselves as stunned. Stunned zombies should not stalk human players, as this can sway the game, and isn't very sportsmanly. A good rule is to stay out of nerf dart range from humans when stunned.</div>

          <div class="even">
            <div><span class="rules_heading">Original Zombies</span></div>
            <div>The Original Zombies are randomly chosen at the beginning of the game. (You can opt-out if you want when you register.) They identify as a Human for a few days (the Original Zombie period). This means that they wear the bandanna on their arm. They tote Nerf blasters, they carry socks, marshmallows, whatever. They can even stun Zombies if they want. For all intents and purposes, they are Human. Except that they can tag Humans to turn them into Zombies. At the end of the Original Zombie period, the Original Zombie becomes a normal Zombie, and must follow the Zombie Rules.</div>
            <div>An email from the mods will be sent when the Original Zombie period ends.</div>
          </div>

          <div class="odd">
            <div><span class="rules_heading">Nerf Devices</span></div>
            <div>The only Nerf devices allowed are:</div>
            <div><OL class="rules">
              <LI>Nerf or other similar foam launching toy blasters.
              <LI>Blow guns firing nerf darts.  (Blow guns must be lung powered, and may not shoot velcro darts.)
              <LI>Balled up socks
              <LI>Regular Marshmallows (No jumbo or mini)
            </OL></div>
            <div><UL class="rules">
              NO MEELE WEAPONS, NO EXCEPTIONS
            </UL></div>
        
            <div>Nerf devices must not look realistic. Federal law requires that toy blasters have a brightly colored tip. We require blasters to be obviously brightly colored - if we think it's too realistic looking, it can't be used. If you're in doubt, ask a mod ahead of time. Please don't paint blasters completely black or other colors found on realistic weaponry. We'll have spray-paint at the orientations to help you make sure your nerf blasters meet standards. All devices except socks and marshmallows must be approved by a Moderator prior to use. Approved devices will be marked as such by a zip-tie.  Projectiles must not hurt on impact.</div>
            <div>Nerf blasters cannot fire anything except foam projectiles such as darts or balls. Socks must be clean. Socks must be thrown; they can be modified, but only by adding more socks, not by cutting or by adding anything but socks. Marshmallows must be thrown and cannot shot with blow guns.
</div>
            <div>Only commercially available, off-the-shelf darts may be used in nerf blasters. For safety reasons, darts may not be modified to affect their flight performance in any way.</div>
            <div>All ammunition must be cleaned up by whoever fired it. Don't leave darts and marshmallows and socks lying around. Be respectful of campus - ours is a beautiful one, let's keep it that way.</div>
            <div>If a moderator says a Nerf device is not allowed, then it is not allowed. Moderators do not need to cite a rule to ban Nerf devices. If you have a problem with this, you can appeal to another moderator.</div>
            <div>DO NOT under any circumstances attempt to tag someone who isn't clearly marked as a player. Doing so will result in immediate removal from the game.</div>

            <div><span class="rules_heading">Missions</span></div>
            <div>Through the week, there will be various missions posed to both teams. By completing these missions, you earn benefits for your team, or detriments for your opposition. Failure to complete mission may have negative consequences for your team, or positive consequences for the other team. Missions are, of course, completely optional, but highly recommended, because they are fun. The final mission on the last day will determine the winner of the game, if it is not already over. The missions are supposed to add some depth to the game, suspense to events, and to give the Humans a reason to get out of the safe zones where the Zombies can tag them.</div>
            <div>Special mission rules:</div>
            <div><OL class="rules">
              <LI>No vehicles at mission!  Vehicles may be used to get to or from missions, but their use during missions to complete mission objectives or help with the mission in any way is banned.
              <LI>Buildings may not be used as cover or passage during missions.
              <LI>Stairs may not be used as a play zone unless specifically told by a mod for the purpose of moving from one location to the other.

            <div><span class="rules_heading">Costumes</span></div>
            <div>  Costumes are permitted (and encouraged!), but they must not be alarming to the public.  For safety reasons, the following rules will be enforced:</div>
            <div><OL class="rules">
              <LI>Camouflage may not be worn in bushes. No FULL camo is allowed either.
              <LI>Ghillie suits may not be worn at all.
              <LI>Costumes may not conceal the face at night.
              <LI>The costume may not contain banned weaponry or devices, even for looks.
            </OL></div>
          </div>

          <div class="even">
            <div><span class="rules_heading">Other Rules</span></div>
            <div>A mod does not need to cite a rule to make a ruling during game.</div>
            <div>The mod squad will never use Facebook, twitter, etc. to distribute mission details.</div>
            <div>Tagging non-players is a bannable offense. And a rude move. Don't do it.</div>
            <div>People who are not part of the game cannot interact with it. This includes spying or bringing supplies to barricaded Humans.</div>
            <div>Zombies must have both feet outside a safe zone to tag a Human.</div>
            <div>Shields are not allowed. Neither are melee weapons.  A tag on a backpack is considered a tag on the player (otherwise the backpack would be a shield, which is not allowed).</div>
            <div>Athletes during practices or games are safe.</div>
            <div>Anyone participating in official or required events, such as jobs or meetings, is safe.</div>
            <div>Humans may stun Zombies from inside safe zones to clear exits.</div>
            <div>Those that are required to wear a uniform, such as players in ROTC, are not required to wear the headband during that time. This effectively removes them from the game for that amount of time; as such, they cannot be tagged.</div>
            <div>Unless you're in a sanctioned activity, please don't remove yourself from the game. Taking off your bandanna to walk to class falls under DBAD.</div>
            <div>If there is a real emergency, call 911.  For game-related, non-emergency help please try to find a mod (wearing a pink arm/headband) or email mods@osundead.com.</div>
            <div>Finally, the overall rule is: DBAD - Don't be a douche. If at any time you think you are violating this rule, stop and think about it. If something seems unfair, it probably is. If it seems un-fun, then something is probably wrong. This is a game, and games are meant to be fun. Try and play the game in a way that makes it good for everyone involved. Don't be selfish. And lastly, HAVE FUN!</div>
